# Why I decided to create a Blog!

<MetaInfo></MetaInfo>

Hey there! My name is _Adithya Kashyap_ and welcome to my blog.
Today, I want to talk about why I decided to create a Blog (Yet Another? I know!).

Before we get started, I want to explain a little bit about myself. My name is **_Adithya_** and I am currently working as a **_Senior Software Engineer_** at **[Walmart Global Tech](https://www.walmart.com/)** and I am based out of the DC Metro area. Checkout my **[Portfolio](https://www.adithyakashyap.com)** here.

Personally, I am not much of a reader of any types of books. I like to have some visual aids to help me learn anything. Also I am trying to get better at things that I learn so its easy to refer back to.
This blog is my attempt to try both of these for myself. I am not trying to be perfect in either one of them but I want to enjoy this process and share my insights with everyone.

### Intentions for this blog

I know there a billion of these blogs on the internet talking about Tech but I wanted this to be _`Mine!`_

- Serve as a Digital bookmark of my learnings professionally and personally.
- Hopefully help a few people to learn and/or understand similar solutions to our problems.
- Try out new tools and technologies and build a small community where we help each other do better.

> **Disclaimer:** All posts here are just my own opinion based on my learnings. Please reach out to me [here] for any questions/concerns/suggestions.

## Tech used to build this blog

This Blog has been built using a number of awesome open source projects and I want to mention some of them and the reason to do so:

- [ReactJS] - I have always used Angular in the enterprise and wanted to learn something that is quick and easy to learn and that doesn't have a steep learning curve. All you need is basic **JavaScript** understanding!
- [Next.JS] - A full stack React framework. This framework provides a good foundation on which you can get started without worrying about setting up boilerplate code especially when you want to learn/build something quick.
- [TailwindCSS] - CSS Framework. Coming from a non-design background, writing a lot of plain css is so verbose and cumbersome to implement what I visualize. That is when I stumbled upon Tailwind and I am really glad I found it! Its a utility first framework where you embed css classes within the html (css-in-js if you want to explore more) and this makes implementing your styles right in the html and the library makes it a breeze to work with anything in css.
- [Markdown] - I decided to build my blog using **Markdown**. It makes it so easy to structure your content and easy to maintain and get decent styles out of the box. I used [Next-MDX-Remote], [gray-matter] and some [Remark] libraries to parse and display the formatted markdown content on the page.
- [Vercel] - Since I use the [Next.JS] framework and most of the content is static for now, I decided to go with using Vercel for my hosting needs. It makes it so easy to just push my code to GitHub and triggers a deployment using a webhook.
- [Firebase] - I am planning to use this platform for some quick and dynamic features like Firestore and Authentication. (TODO)

### Tools

- **[Visual Studio Code]** - Best editor (personally) for all things JavaScript.
- **[iTerm2]** - Terminal Emulator for macOS.
- **[Google Chrome]** - Browser
- **MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid-2015)**
- **Display** - Two Dell 27 USB-C Hub Monitor - P2722HE

So this is a little bit of myself and what I do. If you would like to know more about me, you can connect with me on [LinkedIn] or contact me [here]. I plan to add a few articles every month
with new stuff that I learn both personally and at work but feel free to reach out to me if you have suggestions. :v:
